# pi-cosmos

The Pi Cosmos Git repo is the official repository for the Pi Cosmos platform, featuring the latest source code, documentation, and development tools. Pi Cosmos is built using a variety of cutting-edge technologies, including Python, Flask, React, and PostgreSQL, and is designed to be highly scalable, modular, and customizable

# pi-cosmos

pi-cosmos is a set of scripts and tools for setting up and managing a Raspberry Pi cluster. The main script, pi-cosmos.sh, is used to install and configure the necessary software on each node in the cluster. The project also includes several other scripts for managing and monitoring the cluster.

# Getting Started

To get started with pi-cosmos, you will need the following:

1. A group of Raspberry Pi computers (at least two)
2. A network switch or router to connect the Raspberry Pi computers
3. A USB drive (at least 8GB) for each Raspberry Pi
4. A computer with SSH access to the Raspberry Pi computers

Once you have gathered the necessary hardware, follow these steps to set up your cluster:

1. Download the pi-cosmos repository to your computer.
2. Insert a USB drive into your computer and format it using the FAT32 file system.
3. Copy the pi-cosmos repository to the USB drive.
4. Insert the USB drive into a Raspberry Pi and boot the Raspberry Pi from the USB drive.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each Raspberry Pi in the cluster.
6. Connect the Raspberry Pi computers to the network switch or router.
7. Use SSH to connect to one of the Raspberry Pi computers.
8. Run the pi-cosmos.sh script to install and configure the necessary software on the cluster.

# Customizing the Cluster

You can modify the pi-cosmos scripts to suit your specific needs, such as installing additional software or changing the cluster's configuration. To do this, edit the scripts using a text editor and save the changes to the USB drive. The changes will be applied to the cluster the next time the scripts are run.

# Monitoring and Managing the Cluster

The pi-cosmos project includes several scripts for monitoring and managing the cluster. These scripts can be used to view the status of the cluster, start and stop services, and perform other tasks.

- pi-cosmos-status.sh: View the status of the cluster.
- pi-cosmos-start.sh: Start services on the cluster.
- pi-cosmos-stop.sh: Stop services on the cluster.
- pi-cosmos-restart.sh: Restart services on the cluster.
